Strangely enough the two terms 上座部 and 分别说部 occur in the Pāli surtas which were compiled long before there emerged a school of Buddhist thought that came to be known by these two terms. We find the term 上座部 in the Pāli sutras which relate the bodhisatta's meeting with Alāra the Kālāma and Uddaka the son of Rāma. After having learned the teaching imparted by them the bodhisatta declared his mastery of their teaching by using the two words fianavāda and 上座部! Obviously in this particular context the term 上座部 does not occur in the sense of “Doctrine of the Elders”. It occurs in a sense which according to its commentarial gloss means “profession of certainty of conviction” (上座部n ti thirabhāva- vādam).? In the same way the other word fianavāda which occurs together with 上座部 means “profession of knowledge” (fidnavādan ti jānāmt ti vādam). Here, both terms are used to emphasize the bodhisatta's thorough grasp of what was taught by Alāra the Kālāma and Uddaka the son of Rāma.

On the other hand, the term 分别说部 occurs in a more technical sense to mean a qualifed answer, an analytical explanation, or a statement of conditional assertion. It is often contrasted with ekamsavāda which means an unqualified answer, or a categorical statement either in the affirmative or in the negative.* But as another name for 上座部 what does 分别说部 really mean? Under what historical circumstances, due to what doctrinal reasons, if any, and in which period in the history of Buddhist thought did these two terms become mutually convertible?

Now the identification of 上座部 with 分别说部 can be traced to the traditional accounts of the Third Buddhist Council as presented in the Mahavamsa and the two commentaries to the Vi-naya and the Kathāvatthu, and not to its earlier version as recorded in the Dipavamsa.* The accounts given in the three works, men-tioned first, are more or less the same in content and are couched in more or less the same language. They all begin with a continuous narration of a series of episodes culminating in the main event. This involves a detailed account of the life of the Venerable Moggaliputta Tissa Thera who presided at the Council, the conversion of King Asoka to Buddhism, his many acts of beneficence and lavish gifts to the Saṅgha, the entry into the Dispensation (sasana) of heretics who masqueraded as Buddhist

monks declaring their own doctrines as the true Word of the Buddha, the postponement of the Uposarha ceremony for a period of six years because of the heretics within the Sarigha, the kings abor-tive attempt at reconciliation through his minister Mahādeva, the remorse felt by the king over this act, his meeting with the Venerable Moggaliputta Tissa Thera who declares that the king has no moral responsibility over this act, and the Thera's instruction to the king on the teaching of the Buddha for seven consecutive days at the Royal Park.

On the seventh day the King Asoka had the community of monls assembled at Asokārāma. He got an enclosure of screens prepared and took his seat within this enclosure. Getting the monks to group themselves according to the divergent views they professed, the King summoned each group of monks in turn and asked this question: “What was the Perfectly Enlightened One a teacher of' (Kimvādr Sammā Sambuddho). In response to this question those who believed in eternalism replied that the Buddha was an advocate of eternalism. Those who believed in qualified eternalism replied that the Buddha was an advocate of qualified eternalism. Likewise those who propounded theories of finiteness and infinitude, the eel-wrigglers, casuits, those who professed theories of conscious existence, non-conscious existence, neither conscious nor non-conscious existence, annihilationists and those who professed Nibbāna of this life also replied according to the views they held. It was not difficult for the King who had already learnt the Dhamma to realize that they were not Buddhist monks but heretics who belonged to other persuasions. The King gave them white garments and expelled all of them, numbering 60000 in all, from the community of monks. Next the King summoned the remaining monks and asked the same question: “What was the Perfectly Enlightened One a teacher of?' They said in reply, “Great King, He was Vibhajjavādr ". Being replied so, the King in order to get this confirmed asked the Venerable Moggaliputta Tissa Thera, “Was the Perfecily Enlightened One Vibhajjavādr. “Yes, Great King, replied the Thera. Thereupon King Asoka told Venerable Moggaliputta Tissa Thera, “Venerable Sir, the Dispensation is now pure, let the fraternity of monks perform the Uposatha.' At this assembly, numbering 60000 monks, the Venerable Moggaliputta Tissa Thera recited the treatise called Kathāvatthu in order to refute the heretical views. Even as the Elders, Kassapa the Senior and Yasa the son of Kākandaka, rehearsed the Dhamma and Vinaya, he, too, selected thousand monks from those numbering 60,000, who were well versed in the learning of the Threefold Knowledge and rehearsed the Dhamma and Vinaya. Thus rehearsing the Dhamma and Vinaya, he purified the Dispensation of all stains and held the Third Council.S  

It will be seen that the most important, in fact the very pivotal, word in this account is vibhajjavadi which we have left un-translated. A proper interpretation of this word will not only show why the 上座部 came to be called 分别说部 but would also shed much light on the actual causes that led to the Third Council.

The first-ever rendering of 分别说部 into English could per-haps be traced to George Turnour' translation of the Mahavamsa (1868), where we find it rendered as “the religion of investigated truth”.“ In his A Dictionary of the Pāli Language (1875) R. C. Child-ers explained the term as “Religion of Logic or Reason”. In this con-nection Childers also took into consideration its earlier rendering into English by George Turnour, for he observes that this latter ren-dering is not inappropriate” One of the earliest to endorse Childers' interpretation was Wilhelm Geiger who, in his Mahavamsa transla-tion, observes that it renders the sense of the term very appro-priatelyS Since then we find this interpretation being recognized and sometimes developed upon to mean that the Buddha always followed the analytical method and therefore Buddhism could rightly be called a doctrine of analysis.?

In this appendix we propose to show that this particular inter-pretation of the term 分别说部, when it stands as another name for 上座部, does not appear to be corroborated either by textual evidence or by historical data. Its fallacy, it seems to us, stems from its failure to take into consideration the textual and the doctrinal context in which this term assumes its significance. For the term does not lend itself to a correct interpretation when it is sought to be explained in isolation from its proper frame of reference.

As already noted, we can trace the reasons that led to the use of the term 分别说部 as another expression for 上座部 to the traditional account of the Third Council. It is strange, however, that a word of such significance should have been left unexplained in the works where this account occurs. This situation is perhaps responsible for there being more than one explanation in the Pāli sub-commentaries as to why the Buddha is vibhajjavādi. The sub-commentary to the Mahāvamsa explains it as: “[The Buddha is] vib-hajjavadr because he analyses [the individual being] into aggregates” (khandhānam vibhajjakattā vibhajjavādi) !* We are not sure whether this refers to the analysis of the individual being into aggregates or to the analysis of the aggregates, in turn, into dhammas, the basic factors of empirical reality as presented in the Abhidhamma. In whichever way we interpret it, it is on the importance of analysis that the emphasis is laid.
It is of course true that analysis plays an important role in the Buddhist teachings both of the Pāli surras and of the Abhidhamma. However, īt is equally true that no less important a role is played by synthesis as well. If the early Buddhist teachings on the khandhas, āyatanas and dhatus and the Abhidhamma teaching on the dhammas represent the analytical aspect of Buddhism, the Buddhist principles of causality and conditionality highlight the importance attached to synthesis. Let us also recall here that the dhamma theory of the Ab-hidhamma is based not only on analysis (bheda) but on synthesis (saṅgaha) as well.

Therefore to represent Buddhism as a doctrine of analysis is to overlook the importance attached to synthesis in the Buddhist me-thodology:
The Sāratthadīpanī, a Vinaya subcommentary, says that the Buddha is called vibhajjavadi because he follows the method of qual-ified explanation whereby he is able to avoid such extremist views as eternalism and annihilationism!" On the other hand, according to Vimativinodani, another subcommentary to the Vinaya, the Buddha is “ekanta-vibhajjasīla”/? This seems to suggest that the Buddha always maintains the 分别说部 stanāpoint. Both explanations, it seems to us, fail to give a satisfactory explanation for the presence in the discourses of the Buddha of categorical statements (ekamsa-vada) as well.

This whole situation will become clear if we refer here to the well-known Buddhist classification of questions into four groups, which is as follows:
1. pañho ekamsa-vyākaraniyo, a question which should be ans-wered categorically, either in the affirmative or in the negative.
2. pañho vibhajja-vyakaraniyo, a question which should be ans-wered analytically, in other words, a question to which a qualified answer should be given.
3. pañho paṭipuccha-vyākaraniyo, a question which should be answered by raising a counter-question, the need for the coun-ter-question being due to the ambiguities in the original question.
4. pañho thapaniyo, a question which should be set aside, a question to which no answer should be given.
It will be seen that the four kinds of question imply four corres-ponding kinds of answer as well. It will also be seen that among them one kind of answer is not considered superior or inferior to any other kind of answer. The sequence of their enumeration does not in any way imply a theory as to their degrees of validity. Each kind of an-swer, when apposite, is equally valid and equally commendable. What determines the validity of the answer is whether it belongs to the same class to which the question belongs. Hence the Buddha says that a person who does not answer categorically a question which ought to be answered categorically, who does not answer analyti-cally a question which ought to be answered analytically, who does not answer with a counter-question a question which ought to be answered by raising a counter-question, and who does not set aside a question which ought to be set aside — such a person is indeed not fit to discuss with (akaccha)!?

It is in conformity with this situation that we find in the Pāli surtas statements which can be cited as examples for all the four modes of explanation. A typical example of an ekamsavadi or cate-gorical statement is the recurrent formula: sabbe sarikhārā aniccā (all conditioned phenomena are impermanent), or: sabbe dhamma anattta (all things are devoid of a self-entity).

Before we come to the second kind of question, let us take the third and the fourth. A good example for the third is the answer given by the Buddha to the question whether consciousness is one thing and the soul another. Before the Buddha answers it he raises a counter-question in order to clarify what the interlocutor takes to be the soul!* The best example for the fourth category is the Buddhas setting aside of ten questions without providing answers to them. These relate to whether the world is finite or not in terms of time and space, whether the life- principle and the physical body are identical or not, and whether the Tathāgata, the one who has gained emancipation, exists after deafh, or does not exist, or both exists and does not exist, or neither exists nor non-exists.

Now let us take the second mode of explanation in the four-fold classification, which we postponed to be considered last. This refers to questions to which qualifed or analytical answers/explanations should be given. An example for this is found in the Subha Sutta of the Majjhimanikāya which records a conversation between the Buddha and Subha, the young man. When Subha asks the Buddha for his opinion on the proposition that it is a house-holder and not a recluse who would succeed in obtaining what is right, just, and good, the Buddha says in reply: Vibhajjavādo'ham ettha mānava, nāham ettha ekamsavādo. That is: “Here (ettha), O young man, I give

an analytical explanation; I do not make here (erha) a categori-cal assertion”! For, as the Buddha says, fhe answer to the question raised by Subha depends, not on whether the person is a layman or a monk, but on the person's conduct, whether the conduct is good or bad. It will be seen that the use of the adverbial form ertha in the answer given by the Buddha is of great significance. It means “here””, “herein”, “in this respect”, or to be more precise, “in rela-tion to the question raised by Subha”. Its significance lies in the fact that it clearly indicates the specific context in which the Buddha gives his answer following the vibhajjavada method. If we were to overlook this context-indicating term effha, as is sometimes donej“ it would give the incorrect impression that the Buddha always follows 分别说部 in preference to ekamsavāda; in other words, that he endorses only analytical statements and not universal propositions. But the use of the term etīha prevents us from drawing such a conclusion.

Another instance of the Buddha following the vibhajjavada mode of explanation is recorded in the Ariguttaranikāya: Gārayham kho bhante Bhagavā garahati pāsamsiyam pasamsati. Gārayham kho bhante Bhagavā garahanto pāsamsiyam pasamsanto vibhajjavādo Bhagavā. Na so Bhagavā ettha ekamsavādo!” That is: “Sir, the Blessed One blames what is blamable, praises what is praiseworthy. Sir, by blaming what is blamable and praising what is praiseworthy, the Blessed One speaks after analysing. Here, the Blessed One does not speak categorically”. It is this quotation, more than the one al-ready referred to, which is often cited in modern writings to show that the Buddha is always an advocate of the 分别说部 mode of explanation and therefore that the term vibhajjavada could rightly be used as another expression for early Buddhism. Such a conclusion does not follow because of the simple reason that although the con-text-indicating term ertha does not occur immediately before or af-ter the words, Vibhajjavādo Bhagavā, it does certainly occur in the last sentence of the quotation: Na so Bhagavā ettha ekamsavādo. Here, too, the use of the term eftha is intended to show that if the Buddha does not make a categorical assertion on this issue it is be-cause the context does not warrant it. Again the clear implication is that the Buddha resorts to both 分别说部 (non-categorical) and ekamsavada (categorical) modes of explanation.

It is in consonance with this situation that when Poṭṭhapāda, the wandering ascetic, tells the Buddha, “We do not know of any categorical doctrines preached by the Buddha", the Buddha in reply  

says, “I have taught and laid down doctrines of which it is possible to make categorical assertions and I have taught and laid down doctrines of which it is not possible to make categorical asser-tions”!* Thus the truth of the matter is that according to Buddhism a categorical statement is no less valid, or no less logical than an analytical statement just because it is categorical. Likewise an analytical statement is no less valid, or no less logical than a categorical statement just because it is analytical. What matters is not whether a given statement is categorical or analytical but the context in relation to which the statement is made. It follows therefore that 分别说部 which refers to analytical or qualified explanations has no special claim to be more logical or rational than ekamsavāda which refers to categorical statements. Therefore on the basis of early Buddhist discourses it is not possible to support the view that the use of the term 分别说部 is intended to show that Buddhism endorses only analysis and that by extension this means Buddhism is the religion of analysis.

Now this situation which we have just clarified poses an impor-tant problem in relation to the traditional account of the Third Council to which we have already referred. It may be recalled here that in this account it is maintained that the Buddha is Vibhajjavādr without in any way qualifying this statement, in other words, without specifying the relevant context. It, therefore, gives the impression that the Buddha always maintained the 分别说部 stanāpoint. Clearly this is at Variance with the situation that obtains in the early Buddhist texts, where, as we have noticed, no such claim is made. It is very unlikely that in the account of the Council the term vibhajja-vadr is used in a different sense either. How then are we to reconcile these two situations is the question that arises here.

As an ansvwer to this question Mrs Rhys Davids suggests that although each kind of explanation is, “when apposite, equally com-mendable, yet it is easy to discern that whether established genera-lizations were being atraigned by criticism or whethber as in the Asokan age errors arising from uncritical interpretations of doctrine were to be expunged, the path to purity of views and the hallmark of sagacious exposition lay chiefly in the distinguo or the 分别说部 method of explanation”!* However, as Mrs Rhys Davids herself ob-serves a universal predication (ekamsavada) is no less logical than an analytical statement (vibhijavada) ” Hence this gives rise to the question why only the vibhajjavada stanāpoint should have been sin-gled out as the hallmark of sagacious exposition.

It is of course not impossible to give a broad interpretation to the term 分别说部 so as to include within it all the four modes of explanation. For it may be argued, although this argument may ap-pear rather ingenious, that when one is asked for his opinion on a proposition, the most rational position he should take up before he gives his own explanation is to make a preliminary analysis of the proposition so as to find out to which of the four categories it be-longs. Since this preliminary exercise involves the 分别说部 me-thodology the term 分别说部 could be used as a generic term to denote all the four categories. In such a situation of course the term would stand for both the genus as well as for one of its species. Al-though the possibility of such an interpretation cannot be completely ruled out its probability is very much doubtful. Even in the Buddhist texts where this fourfold classification occurs no indication is given in support of such an interpretation. In solving the problem why in the account of the Third Council the Buddha is represented as vib-hajjavadi we may do well to focus our attention on the following facts: It will be observed that in this account the term vibhajjavādr is used in such a way as to distinguish the teaching of the Buddha from such theories as eternalism and annihilationism. The obvious implication is that more than any other term it brings into focus the essential nature of the Buddhas teaching, the distinctive characteristic of Buddhist thought. However, as Mrs Rhys Davids observes, it is rather surprising why this particular term was selected for this purpose when a term such as anattavādi (one who advocates non-self), or aniccavādi (one who advocates impermanence) could have served the same purpose in a better way2! Besides, the selection of such a term would not give rise to the kind of problem which the use of the term vibhajjvādr has given rise to. We cannot certainly say that the authors of fhis account were not aware of the true import of this term either. What both these circumstances suggest is that there was an important historical reason for retaining the term. Behind the use of this term there seems to lie a nucleus of historical truth which is unvwittingly expressed here. What this nucleus of historical truth is will become clear if we take into consideration the parallel data in the literary sources of other schools of Buddhist thought as well. In the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, for instance, we read: “Those who maintain after having analysed that some things exist, namely the present and the past karma which has not borne its fruit and that some things do not exist, namely the past (karma) which has borne its fruit and the future are called  
Vibhajyavādins”? Here the reference is to the Buddhist doctrinal controversy on the tri-temporality of the dharmas and here the Vibhajyavādins are identified as KāSyapiyas. As to the names of other Buddhist schools which came to be known as Vibhajyavādins, the texts differ. Among the names cited are Kāsyapīvas, Mahāsāṃghikas, Ekavyavahārikas, Lokottaravādins, Kaukkutilkas, and Prajāaptivādins. 2

In this connection Louis de La Vallée Poussin observes that in all probability the Theravādins, too, came to be known as Vibhajjavādins because of the position they took in respect of this self-same controversial issue.* There is in fact much indirect evi-dence in the literary sources of the Theravādins themselves which we propose to adduce in support of this conclusion.

As we have already noted in our 1* Chapter the Theravādins' response to the controversial issue is that only the dhammas in the present phase of time exist, whereas the dhammas in the past and future phases of time do not exist. This explanation, too, follows the 分别说部 method although of course it does not fall on all fours with that of the Kāsyapīyas. The similarity is only in the mode of ex-planation and not in the explanation itself. For here, too, there is neither unconditional assertion nor unconditional negation. While the existence of the dhammas in the present phase of time is as-serted, the existence of the dhammas in the past and future phases of time is negated. It is very likely therefore that it is in the context of this controversial issue that the Theravādins, too, came to be known as Vibhajjavādins.

Another question that we wish to raise here is whether the doc-trinal controversy which we have been referring to served as the major factor that led to the Third Council. According to its tradi-tional account of course what led to the Council was a different state of affairs. It was the entry into the Sarigha of members from other religious persuasions who proclaimed their own views as the Word of the Buddha which resulted in the postponement of the uposatha ceremony for six consecutive years. With the intervention of King Asoka a purification of the sāsana was brought about at the end of which it was decided by the assembly of monks headed by the Venerable Moggaliputta Tissa Thera to convene a Council. The discord within the Sarigha which led to the intervention of king Asoka could be accepted as a historical fact, for the king himself alludes to it in his Minor Pillar Edicts of Sārnārh, Kausambi and Sāfici. What appears rather unlikely, however, is that it also led to the Third Council. The traditional account of the Council, it appears to us, is a mix


of both history and legend where we could detect a confusion between two events both of which are historically true. One is the Buddhist controversy on the tri-temporality of the dhammas, which, we believe, led to the summoning of the Council. The other is the disunity and the resulting state of turmoil within the Sarioha which led to the intervention of King Asoka.

H, as suggested by its traditional account, the Council was summoned to refute the type of speculative views, such as eternal-ism and annihilationism which the non-Buddhist members within the Sargha put forward as the Word of the Buddha, then in the Kathāvarthu, the treatise compiled at the Third Council, we should expect a refutation of those self-same views. But what we get in this treatise instead is a formal refutation of views held by Buddhists other than the orthodox Theravādins. Besides, the arguments and the counter- arguments of the Buddhist sects involved in this doc-trinal controversy are very well recorded in it, Its sixth chapter, “Does all exist” (sabbaṃ atthīti kathā), contains a refutation, from the 上座部 perspective, of the Sarvāstivāda theory and its eighth chapter, “Does some exist” (ekaccaṃ atthīti kathā), contains a refutation of the modified version of the theory held by the Kassapikas-Kasyapiyas.

ÎIn point of fact, the very title (= Kathāvatthu) of the treatise compiled at this Council is, either by accident or by design, reminds us of the Buddhist controversy on the tri-temporality of the dham-mas. For in the Saṃgīti Suttanta of the Dighanikāya we read that there are three kinds of Kathāvatthu, topics of discussion, corres-ponding to the three divisions of time, the past, present and fu-ture.“ Since the treatise called Kathāvatthu, too, deals, among oth-ers, with the existence or otherwise of the dhammas in the three di-visions of time, one cannot fail to notice the resemblance it presents to the three kinds of kathāvatthu mentioned in the Pāli surtas.

An indication of the main event that led to the Third Council is also given in the Vijñānakāya of the Sarvāstivādins Abhidharma Piṭaka, whose authorship is attributed to Arahant Devasarman. What interests us here is the fact that its first chapter is called Maudgalyāyana- skandhaka and as Louis de La Vallée Poussin ob-serves it is extremely likely that the reference here is to the Elder Moggaliputta Tissa who is said to have convened the Third Council.5 Why a chapter of a book belonging to the Sarvāstivādins should be named after a celebrated Elder of the Theravādins is not far to seek. For what we get here is a criticism of the views expressed by the Elder Moggaliputta Tissa  

in rejecting the theory of tri-temporality. Thus the “Does all ex-ist” of the Kathāvatthu and the Maudgalyāyana-skandhaka of Vijiianakāaya represent the two opposite positions taken up by the Theravādins and the Sarvāstivādins over an issue which separated them from each other in the 3rd century BCE.

One question often raised by historians who do not believe in the historicity of the Third Council is why no reference is made to it in any of the Edicts of King Asoka. According to our understanding of the situation, the question does not arise. For as we have already suggested, what in all likelihood led to the Council was the Buddhist controversy on the notion of tri-temporality of the dhammas, an is-sue which did not warrant the intervention of King Asoka. What is more unlikely than the temporal head of the State intervening in the settlement of a metaphysical problem the abstruse implications of which only the erudite monks would have understood? Even accord-ing to the traditional account of the Council it was not King Asoka but the assembly of monks headed by the Venerable Moggaliputta Tissa Thera who decided to convene a Council after the purification of the sāsana by the intervention of King Asoka.

Another question often raised is why unlike the first two Coun-cils the third does not find mention in the literary sources of the other schools of Buddhist thought. One observation made in this re-gard is that it was a “party meeting” confined to the Theravādins and therefore it was ignored by others.” If this were so, then even the first two Councils would not be much different from the third in the sense that we do not hear of a Buddhist Council participated by more than one school of Buddhist thought. As an answer to this question we would like to offer the following explanation.

If a number of Buddhist sects, or for that matter even if all of them, refer to the First Council it is because at the time it was held there were no Buddhist sects and hence we could expect it to be recorded by the Buddhist sects that emerged subsequently as an event connected with their own history, without being prevented from recording it by any sectarian feelings. Similarly all those Budd-hist sects which broke away from the 上座部 sometime after the Second Council could be expected to record it, because it was an event which took place before they branched off into different schools of Buddhist thought. But in the case of the Third Council the situation is somewhat different. For we are not aware of 上座部 undergoing a schism in India after the Third Council. In point of fact, its history in India

after its introduction to Sri Lanka is shrouded in mystery. For all what we know it was in Sri Lanka that the 上座部 split into three fraternities, the Mahāvihāra, the Abhayagiri and the Jetavana. Now there is nothing to suggest that any of these fraternities doubted the historicity of the Third Council, for they all could refer to it as part of their common history. In view of this situation which is peculiar to the Third Council one could understand why all information pertaining to it is confined to the literary sources of Sri Lanka's 上座部 tradition.

What we have observed so far is an attempt to explain why the 上座部 came to be known as 分别说部. In this connection it must also be mentioned here that contrary to what has been ob-served in some Pāli sub-commentaries there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the Pāli commentators were not unaware of the doc-trinal context īn which this term becomes meaningful as another ex-pression for 上座部. Hence it is that in introducing the Buddhist doctrine of causality in the Visuddhimagea, Acariva Buddhaghosa says that he will give a full exposition of it “by delving into the Vib-hajjavadi-maṇḍala (the circle of the Vibhajjavādins)”.5 Since the re-jection on the part of the Theravādins of the Sarvāstivada theory of tri-temporality has a direct relevance to the Buddhist doctrine of causality, it is nothing but proper that this fact should be taken into consideration in any exposition which seeks to bring out its true im-plications. This also explains why a similar idea finds expression in the colophon of the commentary to the Parthāna where we get the Abhidhamma doctrine of conditional relations.?

In concluding this appendix we would like to mention here that no other event in the history of Buddhist thought seems to have ex-erted so much influence on its subsequent history than the Buddhist doctrinal controversy which we have been referring to. At its very outset, as we saw, it precipitated a crisis within the Theravādin fra-ternity which not only led to the summoning of the Third Council but also resulted in the emergence of a new school of Buddhist thought called Sarvāstivāda. It was again this controversy that occasioned the emergence, this time, from among the ranks of the Sarvāstivādins themselves of yet another school of Buddhist thought called Kāsyapiyas. What is called sarvam-asti-vāda or the “all-exists-theory” which came into vogue as a result of this contro-versy played a very decisive role in determining the history of Budd-hist thought in the centuries that followed. In fact, among the post-Asokan Buddhist schools it became one of the hotly debated issues, resulting in  

a bewildering mass of arguments and counter-arguments which find mention in a host of literary works belonging to a number of Buddhist traditions. After the Buddhist Council said to be held in Jalandhara under the patronage of King Kaniska, the Vaibhaṣikas of Kasmir became the chief exponents of this theory. Its main critics were the Sautrāntikas. What provoked much opposition to this theory was that it was said to lead to some kind of substantialism which was radically at variance with the Buddhist teaching on the non-substantiality of all phenomena. A detailed statement of the theory, together with its critique on the part of the Sautrāntilas, is found in Ācārya Vasubandhu's Abhidharmakośabhāṣya. However, since his presentation of the subject was made against the back-ground of its Sautrāntika criticism, it did not get a sympathetic re-sponse on the part of the Vaibhāṣikas. It was in order to meet Ācārya Vasubandhu's criticism of this and other subjects pertaining to the Vaibhāṣika Abhidharma that Acarya Saṃghabhadra composed his well-known treatise, the *Nydyanusāra, a work which has come down to us only in its Chinese translation. Among the Mahāyānists it was mainly the Mādhyamikas who maintained a sustained criticism against the “all exists theory” of the Sarvāstivādins. This is not to suggest that the Madhyamikas were in sympathy with the position taken up by the Theravādins and the Sautrāntikas. For in their opi-nion the so called basic factors of empirical reality (dhammas/ dharmas) are not real even in the present phase of time.
