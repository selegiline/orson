In the Pāli Buddhist exegesis we also find a number of critical observations made in respect of non-Buddhist schools of Indian phi-losophy as well. However, it is mostly the doctrinal tenets of the Sāṃkhya and the Vaiśeṣika systems that attracted the special attention of the Pāli exegetes. The Sāṃkhya is referred to as Kāpilā, the followers of Kapila, the founder of the system, and also as Pakativādino, the Exponents of Primordial Nature, because in their view what is called prakṛti (Pāli: pakati) is the ultimate causal nexus of the world of non-self.23 The Vaiśeṣika is referred to as the theory of Kaṇāda, because he was the founder of this school.24 However, in the pre-commentarial Milindapañha we find Sankhyā and Visesikā used in referring to these two schools.25
As we shall see in detail, the dhamma theory provides the onto-logical foundation for the Abhidhamma philosophy: Briefly stated it means the resolution of the world of experience into a number of ba-sic factors called dhammas, together with an explanation as to their inter- connection and interdependence on the basis of conditional relations. One misconception that has gained currency about this theory is that it amounts to some kind of pluralism. As we have shown in detail in the first chapter, the dhamma theory is based not only on analysis (bheda) but on synthesis (saṅgaha) as well. Analysis, when overemphasized, leads to pluralism. Synthesis, when over-emphasized, leads to monism. What we find in the 上座部 Abhidhamma is a combination of both. This hasenabled it to transcend the binary opposition between pluralism (sabbaṃ puthuttaṃ) and monism (sabbaṃ ekattaṃ), or as one Pāli commentary says, the bi-nary opposition between the principle of plurality (nānatta-naya) and the principle of unity (ekatta-naya).26
As to the two complementary methods of analysis and synthesis, It is necessary to make one observation here. It is that the 说一切有部 overemphasized the analytical method. This led to their theory of tritemporality (trai-kālya) according to which the substance of the dharmas persists in the three divisions of time, fu-ture, present, and past. What we should not overlook here is that even the very expression, sabbatthivāda (sarvāstivāda) by which this school is known amounts to an admission by it of the notion of “sabbaṃ atthi” (all exists). “All exists” (sabbaṃ atthi), it should be noted here, is one of the four extremist philosophical positions men-tioned in the Pāli suttas — the position of extreme realism. Its polar opposite is “nothing exists” (sabbaṃ natthi), which is the Buddhist expression for extreme nihilism. As explicitly stated in the Pāli suttas, the Buddha keeps equally aloof from all such extremist positions through his doctrine of dependent origination.27 
Another issue that requires our attention here concerns the relationship between the dhamma theory and the concept of emptiness (suññata). For this purpose it is necessary to clarify here what exactly Pāli Buddhism means by emptiness. In the words of the Buddha as recorded in a Pāli sutta, the world is empty in the sense that it is empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self (attena vā attaniyena vā suññaṃ).28 Here the world means the world of experience, the only world that Buddhism recognizes. And it is precisely this world that early Buddhism analyses into five khandhas (aggregates), twelve āyatanas (bases of cognition), and eighteen dhātus (elements of cognition), and which the Abhidhamma analyses into eighty-one (conditioned) dhammas. What all this amounts to saying is that the khandhas, āyatanas, and dhātus as well as the dhammas are all empty of a self or of anything pertaining to a self. Thus “empty” and “non- self” become mutually convertible expressions: what is empty is non-self, and likewise, what is non-self is empty. Therefore, from the 上座部 perspective we are at full liberty to restate the well-known statement, sabbe dhammā anattā (all dhammas are non-self), which is common to both early Buddhism and the 上座部 Abhidhamma, as sabbe dhammā suññā (all dhammas are empty).
It is of course true that each dhamma, both mental and material, is defined as “own-nature” (sabhāva).29 However, what we need to remember here is that this so called “own-nature” arises and exists in dependence on a multiplicity of impermanent conditions. As the Pāli commentaries clarify this, strictly speaking, a dhamma is not “that which bears its own-nature”, but “what is being borne by its own conditions”.30 In this connection it is also observed that “own- nature” (sabhāva) does not mean “own-sway” (vasavattitā).31 It will thus be seen that although the term sabhāva is used as a syn-onym for dhamma, it is interpreted in such a way that it means the very absence of sabhāva in any sense that implies a substantial mode of being. In other words, none of the dhammas is a self-entity (atta) or anything pertaining to a self-entity (attaniyena). It is in this sense that we need to understand why the dhammas are “empty” (suñña). Of equal significance is the distinction drawn between two truths, the consensual (sammuti) and the ultimate (paramattha). In almost all other Buddhist schools one truth is considered higher and the other lower than the other. Their very use of the term saṃvṛti for the relative truth clearly indicates this. For saṃvṛti means, not that which reveals, but that which conceals. For the 上座部, on the other hand, there is no hierarchical difference between the two, de-spite the fact that one is called conventional and the other ultimate. This situation is, in fact, fully consonant with the distinction drawn in the Pāli suttas between nītattha, a statement whose meaning is already drawn out, and neyyattha, a statement whose meaning has to be drawn out.32
It is to this twofold distinction that most Buddhist schools trace their double truth. However, it must be emphasized here that the relevant sutta passage does not say that one statement is higher or lower than the other. All it says is that a nītattha-statement should not be understood as a neyyattha-statement and vice versa. One who disregards this distinction, the sutta goes on to say, misrepre-sents the Tathāgata.33 Referring to these two statements, F. Ed-gerton observes: “In Pāli neither is ipso facto preferred to the other; one errs only in interpreting one as if it were the other.”34 He fur-ther observes that in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit literature “a nītārtha text ... is recommended as a guide in preference to one that is neyārtha."35
Here, it is worth noting the well-known saying that the Dhamma is a means to an end and not an end in itself. As an extension of this idea, it came to be recognized that the Dhamma as a means can be presented in many different ways, from many different perspectives. As recorded in the Bahuvedanīya Sutta of the Majjhimanikāya when two disciples of the Buddha, a monk and a layman, had an unstoppa-ble argument as to the number of feelings, Ānanda reported this matter to the Buddha. Then the Buddha told Ānanda that both of them were correct, because they looked at the issue from two dif-ferent perspectives. In this connection the Buddha told Ānanda that he had presented feelings not only as two or three, but also as five, six, eighteen, thirty-six, and one hundred and eight.36 It was on this occasion that the Buddha told Ānanda: pariyāya-desito ayaṃ Ānanda mayā dhammo.37 What this means is that the Dhamma has been presented in many different ways, from many different perspectives (aneka- pariyāyena). The clear message conveyed here is that what accords with actuality, and therefore what is true, can be re-stated from many different perspectives, and needs not be repeated in the same way as a holy hymn or a mantra.
The Dhamma, it may be noted here, is not actuality as such, but a description of actuality It is a conceptual model which describes the nature of actuality through a series of propositions. We find this idea formally expressed in a Pāli commentary: paññattiṃ anatik-kamma paramattho pakāsito.38 That is, it is by not going beyond paññatti that the nature of actuality has been presented. Here the term paññatti means both word (nāma-paññatti) and meaning (at-tha-paññatti).39 Therefore, what this means is that the nature of actuality has been presented within a conceptual framework through the symbolic medium of language. Thus we see that here, as else-where, Buddhism avoids absolutism. There is no one absolutist way of presenting the Dhamma which is valid for all times and climes.
There could be more than one conceptual model encapsulating the nature of actuality. The validity of each will be determined by its ability to take us to the goal, i.e., from bondage to freedom, from ignorance to wisdom, from our present predicament to final eman-cipation. In this connection it is instructive to note here that the Pāli suttas themselves give us a clear indication as to how we should dis-tinguish the Dhamma from what is not the Dhamma. It is that what-ever leads to the cessation of passion (rāga), aversion (dosa), and delusion (moha) is the Dhamma and that whatever leads away from it is not the Dhamma. Thus the criterion is not textual although of course it occurs in the Buddhist texts.
That the Dhamma has been presented from many different perspectives can be seen from the Pāli suttas themselves. To give one example: the Noble Truth of Suffering is usually defined as: Birth is suffering, decay is suffering, and so on until we come to the last item: “in brief, the five aggregates of grasping are suffering”, How-ever, in one passage in the Samyurranikāya where the Four Truths are formally presented, we find the First Truth defined as “the five aggregates of grasping” “ Here the last item in the usual definition of suffering, the one that is most comprehensive, is presented as the meaning of suffering.
What we need to remember here is that “the five aggregates of grasping” is a different way of referring to individual existence in its saṃsāric dimension. Individual existence, from the Buddhist pers-pective, is an impersonal congeries of dependently arising psycho- physical factors which we grasp as “this is mine” (etaṃ mama), “this I am" (eso’ ham asmi), and “this is my self” (eso me attā). But what we grasp in this manner is constantly changing (anicca) and there-fore not under our full control (anattā). This is what Buddhism means by the suffering at the very core of our existence (saṅkhāra-dukkha).41
Thus it is not the five aggregates but the five ageregates of grasping that become a source of suffering. If “the five aggregates of grasping” is another expression for life in saṃsāra, then it can be concluded that what Buddhism is saying is not simply that there is suffering in saṃsāric life, but that saṃsāric life itself is suffering. What we should not overlook here is that by “suffering” Buddhism means conditioned experience, any experience dependent on im-permanent conditions. Any conditioned experience, whether it is ex-tremely pleasant or  otherwise, is suffering because of its depen-dent nature. This should explain why even jhāna-experience, which represents higher levels of mind's unification and therefore higher levels of happiness, is also brought under suffering. For, in the final analysis, even jhana- experience is impermanent and, therefore, conditioned.42 As a matter of fact, Buddhism does not deny the possibility of sensual indulgence and sensual pleasure (kāmasukhallikānuyoga) as is very well shown by Buddhism’s refer-ence to it as one of the two extremist practices that should be avoided. What Buddhism questions is not its impossibility but its va-lidity as a means to emancipation.
There are other examples of presenting the Dhamma in differ-ent perspectives. For instance, in the Saṃyuttanikāya one who has entered the stream (sotāpanna) is described in more than one way.43 In the same nikāya we also find the path leading to the unconditioned (Nibbāna) described in eleven different ways.44  One purpose of referring to these examples is this. By taking these and other similar cases into consideration we should not hasten to con-clude that they represent different historical stages in the devel-opment of Buddhist thought, unless of course there is clear evidence to the contrary. Rather, they should be understood in the light of the statement that the Dhamma can be presented from different pers-pectives.
It is in the light of these observations that we need to under-stand the significance of the commentarial statement, namely, that the Buddha sometimes teaches the Dhamma according to conven-tional truth, sometimes according to ultimate truth, and sometimes through a combination of both.45 As one Pāli commentary says it is like a teacher choosing different dialects to teach his pupils who speak different dialects.46 There is absolutely no implication here that one dialect is either higher or lower than another.
Closely associated with the distinction drawn between two truths is the development by the Abhidhamma of a logical apparatus for defining the dhammas. The first is called agent-denotation (kat-tu-sādhana), the second instrument-denotation (karaṇa-sādhana), the third object-denotation (kamma-sādhana), the fourth loca-tive-denotation (adhikaraṇa-sādhana), and the fifth na-ture-denotation (bhāva-sādhana). Their implications in the context of the dhamma theory will become clear from the chapters that fol-low. However, it is necessary to focus our attention on the first. Here, what is sought to be defined occurs in the nominative case. It exactly corresponds to what we call today the subject-predicate sentence. One example given is: cognition cognizes (viññāṇaṃ vijānāti).47 This kind of definition, it is said, is made by superim-posing a distinction on where there is no such distinction (abhede bheda-parikappanā).48 Such a superimposition creates a distinction between the agent and the action. For this very reason the Abhidhamma says that this kind of definition is tentative and provisional and not valid in an ultimate sense (nippariyāyena).49 It is resorted to only as an aid to understanding. Thus all such innocent- looking sentences as: “I see”, “My eyes see”, “I see with my eyes”, “Eye-consciousness sees” are not valid in an ultimate sense. To make them valid we have to rephrase them in the language of cau-sality. When so rephrased, they all mean: “Depending on the eye and the eye-object arises eye-consciousness". When we say, “It happened,” or “It occurred,” from the Buddhist perspective we mean, “there was a happening,” “there was an occurrencing.”
In point of fact, this is not an Abhidhamma innovation. We find this idea expressed in the Pāli suttas as well. When a monk asked the Buddha, “Who is it, Venerable Sir, that feels”, the Buddha rep-lied: “It is not a fit question (na kallo pañho). I am not saying (someone) feels. If I were saying so, the question would be a fit one. But I am not saying that. If you were to ask thus: Conditioned by what, Venerable Sir, does feeling arise, then the proper answer would be: Conditioned by sensory contact, feeling arises.”50 As will be noticed, what made the Ābhidhammikas evolve this system of definition is their awareness that the structure of actuality does not exactly correspond to the structure of language. We tend to be-lieve that there is an ontological subject corresponding to the grammatical subject. Language is also based on the recognition of a dichotomy between substance and quality (ādhāra-ādheya). This dichotomy, as one Pāli says, is usually expressed through what is called the genitive expression (sāmi-vacana),51 as for example, the colour of the rainbow. Buddhist philosophy of almost all schools be-gins with the abolition of this distinction.
Another important aspect of the 上座部 Abhidhamma con-cerns paññatti, the category of the nominal and the conceptual. Ac-cording to the dhamma theory, only the dhammas are real; all things besides the dhammas are conceptual constructs, or logical abstrac-tions with no objective counterparts. However, there surfaced a trend in certain Buddhist schools towards reversing this process by way of reification. Thus as recorded in the 论事, some Budd-hist schools maintained that “there is an immutable something called thus-ness in the very nature of things, material or otherwise”, which is unconditioned.
Thus distinct from matter, there is materiality of matter (rūpassa rūpatā), distinct from feeling, there is feeling-ness of feel-ing (vedanāya vedanatā) and so forth.52 Some other Buddhist schools elevated the principle of dependent origination to the level of an unconditioned entity.53
The 上座部 held that this process of reification overstepped the bounds of paññatti (paññattiṃ atidhāvitvā gaṇhanti).54 As one Pāli commentary says in this regard, there is no separate entity called dependent origination distinct from the factors that arise in dependence on other factors.55 The same is true, for example, of impermanence. There is no separate entity called impermanence ad-ditional to what is subject to impermanence. If it were otherwise, so runs the argument, then this impermanence would require another impermanence to make it impermanent, and this in turn would re-quire still another, thus resultingin a process of interminability (anupaccheda) or infinite regress (anavaṭṭhāna).56
In the Appendix to this work there is a discussion on why the 上座部 came to be known as 分别说部, “Doctrine of Analysis.” This designation, it seems to us, has to be understood in the context of the doctrinal controversy between the 上座部者 and the 说一切有部 on the tritemporality (trai-kālya) of the dharmas. In the course of this discussion an attempt will be made to show that the Third Buddhist Council was an historical event and not “a pious fabrication” on the part of the 上座部 Buddhist historiography. At the early stages of Buddhist academic studies, it was thought by some scholars that the name of 目犍连长老 (目犍连子·帝须) who, according to 上座部 tradition, presided at the Third Buddhist Council, occurs only in the commentaries and chroni-cles compiled in Sri Lanka. However, as pointed out by Louis de La Vallée Poussin, the Venerable Elder's name occurs in the Chinese version of the Vijñānakāya, one of the seven books of the 说一切有部 Abhidharma Piṭaka.57 As he has pointed out further, the first chapter of this 说一切有部 work is named after 目犍连长老 as Maudgalyāyana-Skandhaka, because its sole purpose is to refute from the 说一切有部 perspective the evidence adduced by the Theravādin Elder against the theory of tri-temporality.58 In point of fact, in the sixth chapter of the 论事, which is said to have been compiled at 第三次结集 by the Theravādin Elder, we find a criticism of the 说一切有部 theory from the 上座部 perspective.
